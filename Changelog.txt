V 1.5

- Terran update, yay!

- Terran station build times reduced to match other races

- Terran engine travel charge matched to other races

- Removed Smart Chip Economy Fix from the code, I think it's now depreciated

- Major redesign of README and restructuring for hosting on Github

- Tweaked Learning All The Things some more

- More indentation and prettiefying

V 1.4

- Dropped the explore alterations, JanPanthera makes better scripts and I'm sick of dealing with Ego breaking and unbreaking the explorer :p

- Revamped all the build module time reductions and corrected some mistakes, currently at 60% 

- Took some inspiration from "No cockpit chair sounds" to drop the annoyance level of those chairs (looking at you dragon)

- Tweaked some of the scan percentage requirements, they were a bit too cheeky after playing a ton of vanilla

- Drastically neutered the amount of mod components vendors sell and the chances they carry them

- Overhauled ALL of the mod componenet prices, no more earning millions for tuning software and buying T3 weapon mods in bulk

- Disabled the smart chip economy fix; been playing vanilla and not seen the same issue from back in the day

- Updated Learning All The Things and lowered some of the values to keep the new beta seminars valuable, also go give iforgotmysocks some love!

- Dropped the time for travel charge of All-Round L engines to 7 seconds. Travel varients are 10 seconds for L and 12 seconds for XL now.

- Lots of spelling/formatting/gramatical tweaks that no one will ever notice or care about in the documentation.

V 1.3

- Fixed station module time reduction not working properly

- Added "Surface Element" mod to the list for removing random stats

- Removed station credit transfer script, it wasn't working and JanPanthera makes a better one

V 1.2

- Removed stations supply build storage script

- Removed collect inventory wares script

- Altered Learning All The Things so that only currently used skills advance

- Added split station modules to the build time reduction list

- Bumped up satellite range slightly

- Put the exporation fixes back in because Egosoft just loves to break things...

- Fixed a file structure problem that caused the split engine charge to not be reduced

V 1.1

- Removed "Turret Cycling Fix", it appears that patching has sorted this out

- Added Split L/XL engines to the travel drive reduction list

- Dropped the Explore Faster/Better Explorer merge as it looks like Ego have improved the exploration command

V 1.0

- Double checked for typos in the Readme/description

- Finally worked up the courage (and got permission) to put my pack on the Nexus!

V 0.9.2

- Added in the No More Weapon Behavior Sound changes, gets rid of that insufferable reloading sound that turrets make

V 0.9.1

- After much play-testing, settled on 80% build time (20% reduction) following the format from Build Time Reduction mod; original was a 10x reduction, WAY too fast to feel right for me

V 0.9

- Build Time Reduction (mjr121) changes merged
- TONS of documentation cleanup, adding credits, etc.
- Fixed indentation and line order in some *.xml files

V 0.8.1

- Tractor beam was a bit unstable, reduced top speed of containers and slightly bumped up the range

V 0.8

- Found unpacked versions for Shorter Travel Drive and Improved Tractor Beam to merge with my other changes

V 0.7

- Added in graphicboy's station account transfer snippet so I could remove the other standalone mod I was using for this purpose

V 0.5

- Faster Explorer (Simmel) tweak merged with an adjusted Improved Explore Command (MegaJohnny) script
- Dropped More NPC's to 50 (default 100) after performance issues on my laptop and silliness in the bars

V 0.4

- Learning all the Things default settings gave me full 5 star crew after a short amount of SETA time. Tweaked and tested lowering all of the different values associated. Settled (for now) at 12% chance for 1 point each hour.

V 0.3

- Combined all the following with no noticeable issues:
- Djfhes Dock Fix
- Faster Explorer
- Learning All The Things
- More NPC's
- Improved Explore Command
- Improved Repair Laser
- Stations Supply Build Storage
- Collect Inventory Wares

V 0.2.2

- Linux is a case-sensitive operating system; learned the hard way
- Going forward, all versions will be fully Linux compatible

V 0.2.1

- It didn't work, only merge a few mods and test for quirks

V 0.2

- It worked! Incorporate ALL THE MODS!

V 0.1

- Did not like some of the settings in the G_Pack mod, opened up Atom and changed things more to my personal taste
- Added in the change from Smart Chip Economy (zebai) into G_Pack's wares.xml
- Begun my journey into learning how basic *.xml mods work
